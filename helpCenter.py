                RepairOS is a helpful software program that allows you to 
                manage your repair shop's intake and payment processes.
                
                When you select 1 at the main menu, you will be prompted
                through a series of entries to input information about the
                item to repair.
                
                Each step of the way you will receive instructions on next 
                steps.
                
                Finally you will be asked if the information entered is 
                correct -- if not you will return to the main menu to restart.
